This directory contains a (fairly random) collection of  simple  scripts
written in Miranda.  To try one out (eg fibs.m) say
	mira fibs
as a UNIX command - or if you are already inside a Miranda session, say
	/f fibs
to  make (e.g.) fibs.m your current script.  To get into this directory,
while in a Miranda session, say
	/cd <ex>

Each script has some explanatory comments in it.  To  read  the  current
script from within a Miranda session say
	/e
which  invokes the editor on the current script.  The scripts are listed
in groups, with some more advanced examples towards the end.   The  ones
marked (*) may be useful as libraries.
